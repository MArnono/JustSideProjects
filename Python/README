> A curated collection of personal utility scripts, automation tools, and small proof-of-concept programs written in Python.

## ðŸ’¡ Overview

This directory serves as a repository for various self-contained Python scripts. These projects are primarily developed to solve small, specific problems, automate repetitive tasks, or explore new Python libraries and features.

Each script or related group of scripts is located in its own sub-folder and includes a brief description of its function.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

All scripts are written for **Python 3**.

To ensure you have the necessary libraries installed for a specific script, navigate to its respective folder. If a script requires external dependencies, its folder will contain a **`requirements.txt`** file.

You can install all dependencies for a script using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r /path/to/script/requirements.txt
